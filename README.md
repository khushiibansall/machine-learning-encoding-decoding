# Image Encoding and Decoding

This project implements image encoding and decoding techniques such as Run-Length Encoding (RLE), Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT), and Lempel-Ziv-Welch (LZW). It includes a Gradio interface for users to upload images and visualize the encoded data. Ideal for educational purposes and basic image processing demonstrations.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/khushiibansall/machine-learning-encoding-decoding.git
   ```
2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. Run the Gradio interface:
   ```sh
   python encoding.py
   ```
2. Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:7860` to access the interface.
3. Upload an image and select an encoding method (RLE, DCT, or LZW) to visualize the encoded data and compare it with the original image.
