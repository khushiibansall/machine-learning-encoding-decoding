 Image Encoding and Decoding This project implements image encoding and decoding techniques such as Run-Length Encoding (RLE), Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT), and Lempel-Ziv-Welch (LZW). It includes a Gradio interface for users to upload images and visualize the encoded data. Ideal for educational purposes and basic image processing demonstrations.
